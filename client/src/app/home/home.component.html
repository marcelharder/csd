                This application gives a real time overview of the available
                prosthetic heart valves in your hospital. It allows a cardiac
                surgeon to plan the operative procedure with the confidence that
                the intended prosthesis is really available. On the other hand
                it gives valve vendors a realtime overview of the location of
                their products. This enables them to intelligently supply the
                hospitals that they are working with.

                Patient Prosthesis Mismatch (PPM) occurs when the effective
                orifice area of a prosthetic heart valve is too small in
                relation to the required aortic valve area, leading to higher
                than expected gradients across the valve. The required aortic
                valve area is determined based on the patient's individual
                characteristics and expressed in a newly defined algorithm that
                takes in the gender, the age, the height and the weight of the
                patient. This condition can result in suboptimal hemodynamic
                performance and may impact patient outcomes following valve
                replacement surgery.
