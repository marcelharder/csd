                  This application is designed to measure the surgical outcomes
                  for the individual cardiac surgeon. The surgeon can monitor
                  the outcomes in real time and these data are private. Because
                  this application is surgeon-centric the application has no
                  dependencies on the hospital where the surgeon works. View it
                  as a surgical logbook with advanced capabilities.

                  This application gives a real time overview of the available
                  prosthetic heart valves in your hospital. It allows a cardiac
                  surgeon to plan the operative procedure with the confidence
                  that the intended prosthesis is really available. On the other
                  hand it gives valve vendors a realtime overview of the
                  location of their products. This enables them to intelligently
                  supply the hospitals that they are working with.

                  This application records the outcomes of the use of the
                  CardioHelp machine This CardioHelp machine gives
                  extracorporeal support for, amongst others, pulmonary and
                  cardiac conditions. The CardioHelp machine collects a huge
                  amount of hemodynamic, operational and alarm conditions, up to
                  54 variables every 5 minutes. To manage these data it is very
                  helpful to have a dedicated, cloud based, web application.
                  With these data neatly stored in the cloud we can learn to
                  finetune the indications for extracorporeal support. These
                  data are anonymously collected and therefore there are no

                  Patient Prosthesis Mismatch (PPM) occurs when the effective
                  orifice area of a prosthetic heart valve is too small in
                  relation to the required aortic valve area, leading to higher
                  than expected gradients across the valve. The required aortic
                  valve area is determined based on the patient's individual
                  characteristics and expressed in a newly defined algorithm
                  that takes in the gender, the age, the height and the weight
                  of the patient. This condition can result in suboptimal
                  hemodynamic performance and may impact patient outcomes
                  following valve replacement surgery.

                  This application was developed to streamline a referral for
                  cardiac surgery. All the information about the patient is
                  presented to the surgeon. This information includes the
                  angiogram, echo's and other additional investigations that are
                  relevant to the referral. With all the information about a
                  potential surgical case in one place, the surgeon can quickly
                  estimate the surgical risk and envisioned benefit of the
                  surgical procedure. The main benefit of this application is
                  the significant reduction of administrative tasks that
                  accompany a referral for cardiac surgery.
